## Technologies

This block explorer support multiple chains in the same running instance. It is built on Angular and runs an Single Page Application.

## Legacy Explorer

Our previous Block Explorer was built on ASP.NET Razor technology and the repo has been moved
to [blockcore-explorer-legacy](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore-explorer-legacy) repository.

If you want to use and deploy the legacy explorer, make sure you run version 0.0.X of the docker images.

From version 0.1.X, the docker images will be our new explorer.
